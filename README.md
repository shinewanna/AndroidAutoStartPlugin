# **Android AutoStart**

This Flutter library allows requesting to enable Auto Start permission for Android Flutter apps.

There are devices manufacturers that don't allow applications auto starts by default. This makes difficult (not to say impossible) to run apps in background on their devices. However, a simple solution for that is show to users the Auto Start Setting screen. The access to that screen varies by manufacturer. Thus, with this plugin is possible navigate to Auto Start Setting screen in a simple way.

## **Installation**

Add `android_autostart` to the dependencies list
of the `pubspec.yaml` file as follow:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  android_autostart:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/Jeferson505/AndroidAutoStartPlugin.git
      ref: v1.0.1
```

Then run the command `flutter pub get` on the console.

```dart
import 'package:android_autostart/android_autostart.dart';
